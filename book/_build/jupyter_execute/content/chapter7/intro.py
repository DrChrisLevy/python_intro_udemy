# # Chapter 7: Intro to Classes
# 
# In this chapter we will introduce Python classes
# and some concepts from object oriented programming.
# Much like the rest of this book, this chapter is not meant 
# to cover all related topics. It will give you the basic knowledge
# and then you can pursue more learning on your own. In this chapter
# we will cover the following topics:
# 
# - defining and creating classes
# - instantiate an object from a class
# - instance methods and attributes
# - class methods and attributes
# - subclassing and inheritance
