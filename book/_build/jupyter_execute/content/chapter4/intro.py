# # Chapter 4: Data Structures
# 
# In this chapter we will learn about the common **data structures** used in Python.
# 
# - list
# - tuple
# - dictionary
# - set
# 
# In this chapter you will begin with learning more about lists. Then we will move on to
# tuples, dictionaries, and sets. We will also learn more about functions and how to use `*args` and `**kwargs**`. Here are some of the things you will learn at a high level.
# 
# - lists
#     - more list methods
#     - list comprehensions
# - tuples
# - dictionaries
#     - keys and values
#     - ways of iterating over dictionaries
# - sets
# - using `*args` and `**kwargs` in function definitions
#
