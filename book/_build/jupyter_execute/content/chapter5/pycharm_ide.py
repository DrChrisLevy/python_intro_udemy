# # Pycharm IDE
# 
# In this section we will be using how to learn Pycharm
# so we can start coding in a proper editor. Jupyter Notebook
# is great for experiments and trying things out but most people end
# up developing code within a proper interactive development environment (IDE).  An IDE is basically a  text editor that includes lots of other specific features to assist with developing code.
# 
# There are many options out there for IDEs and just do a quick Google for [coding IDE options](https://www.google.com/search?q=Coding+IDE+options&oq=Coding+IDE+options&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60.729j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).
# 
# In this course we will use [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). I'm not going to write out in this book how to install and set it up because there is already so much stuff on the web that you can read to do that. Just checkout the [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) website and their documentation is really good. We will be using
# the **community edition** because it's free. If you are taking the [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-to-code-with-an-introduction-to-python-3/?referralCode=42FB26846F76E2E41EF8) that goes along with this book then you can check out the videos there for how to install and set up Pycharm with virtual environments. Also in the videos I will be showing you how to set up simple project structures and creating virtual environments for them and linking the two together in Pycharm. You will also learn more about import statements and how to create your own modules and how to import code from those modules. This material will most likely not be written out in this section of the book because it is not written in Jupyter Notebooks (what this book is built off of). So head over to the [Chapter 5 Udemy course videos](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-to-code-with-an-introduction-to-python-3/?referralCode=42FB26846F76E2E41EF8) to see the specific content for the rest of this chapter.
