# # Book Introduction
# 
# Welcome to this course on an intro to coding in Python.
# This online resource is meant to go along with my [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-to-code-with-an-introduction-to-python-3/?referralCode=42FB26846F76E2E41EF8). There you will find a ton of video content of me teaching the same material from this online book, often with more detail. This online book is not meant to be a single resource to learn Python. It's just a tool to get you started. Once you learn the basics then you should start working on small projects and continue to learn on your own.
