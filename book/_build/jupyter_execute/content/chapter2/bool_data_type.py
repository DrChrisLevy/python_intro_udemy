# # Boolean Data Type
# 
# In computer programming, a **boolean** data type is a data type that
# can have one of *two* values which are usually denoted as *true*
# and *false*. In Python the syntax for these two values are `True`
# and `False`. These two values are built into the Python
# programming language and are of type **boolean** or **bool**
# for short.
# 
# Create a new Jupyter Notebook and call it **booleans_comparison_logical_operators**.
# Type out the code as you read and go through this. Play around with code
# because it will help you to learn!

# They are case sensitive. If you try writing for example, `true`, or `FALSE`, or some variation
# you will get an error.
# 
# So why is this important? Well, often programs are made up
# of lots of tiny decisions that depend on various outcomes.
# For example, you might want to perform some logic *if something is `True`*
# or perform different logic *if something is `False`*. This is why
# boolean data types are so important.
# 
# You may be wondering how does something evaluate to `True` or `False`? 
# To start learning more about this we are going to introduce
# the Python *comparision operators*.
