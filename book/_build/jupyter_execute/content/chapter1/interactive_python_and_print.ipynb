    "When you code in Python, you end end up writing lines of code across lots of different files.\n",
    "It is very common for larger Python projects to have thousands of lines of code.\n",
    "But when you are first starting to code, it is ideal to write some lines of code \n",
    "and then see what they do instantly. This experience is interactive and is\n",
    "ideal for learning and playing around with Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are couple of ways to start *interactive sessions* with Python.\n",
    "For example, if you have Python installed on your computer you can open\n",
    "up a terminal/shell and just type `python` or `python3`. Here is an example of\n",
    "what that looks like. ![python3_terminal](python3_terminal.png) \n",
    "\n",
    "Each line starts with `>>>` and you can simply type some\n",
    "python code and then hit **return** on your keyboard to execute it. \n",
    "Here I typed `1 + 1` and then hit **return**.\n",
    "Then the code was executed instantly and the output was displayed on the screen, `2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try it out on your own! Open a terminal/shell and type `python3`. \n",
    "Then try adding two numbers together. \n",
    "You can type `quit()` and then **return** to exit the interactive python shell in the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to work in python in a very rich interactive environment is by using\n",
    "**Jupyter Notebooks**. If you have **Jupyter** installed you can just open\n",
    "a terminal/shell on your computer and type `jupyter notebook` and hit **return** on the keyboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "![jupyter_notebook_terminal](jupyter_notebook_terminal.png) \n",
    "\n",
    "You can copy and paste the link `http://localhost:8889/?token=d844c610f304b048803cb24f809ece636c126c0dce446800` in your web browser. Or it might even open automatically. In the web browser you will see something like this: ![jupyter_notebook_home](jupyter_notebook_home.png)\n",
