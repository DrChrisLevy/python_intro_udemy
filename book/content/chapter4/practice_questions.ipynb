    "a) Use list comprehensions to create a list of integers between (and including) 16 and 57.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Use list comprehensions to create a list of **odd** integers between (and including) 11 and 31.\n",

    "c) Given the list `x = [1, 2, 'hello world', -3, 5]` use list comprehensions and `enumerate` to create a new list `[(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 'hello world'), (3, -3), (4, 5)]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "d) Given a list of numbers in a variable called `numbers`, use list comprehensions to extract all the numbers with a position/index that is a multiple of 3. For example, if `numbers` was the list `[7, 5, 6, 9, 4, 5, 2]` then the list comprehension would create the list `[7, 9, 2]` because those numbers were at positions 0,3,6. Remember that you can use conditionals in list comprehensions and you can use `n % 3 == 0` to check if a number `n` is a multiple of 3. Also, you will want to use `enumerate` in the list comprehension so that you have the position of each item. "
