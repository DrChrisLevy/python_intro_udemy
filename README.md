# Learn to code with an Introduction to Python 3

This repo contains the Jupyter Notebooks and resources
for my Udemy course [Learn to code with an Introduction to Python 3](https://www.udemy.com/course/draft/3497946/?referralCode=42FB26846F76E2E41EF8).
It also contains all 
the [book content](https://drchrislevy.github.io/python_intro_udemy/content/chapter1/intro.html) 
which is an important resource for the Udemy course and all the Jupyter Notebooks
from the video lessons.
